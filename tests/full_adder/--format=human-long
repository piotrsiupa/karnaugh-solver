--- sum ---

goal:
   0 1 
00 F T
01 T F
11 F T
10 T F

solution:
(in0 && in1 && carry_in) || (in0 && !in1 && !carry_in) || (!in0 && in1 && !carry_in) || (!in0 && !in1 && carry_in)

Gate cost: NOTs = 6, ANDs = 8, ORs = 3


--- carry_out ---

goal:
   0 1 
00 F F
01 F T
11 T T
10 F T

solution:
(in0 && in1) || (in0 && carry_in) || (in1 && carry_in)

Gate cost: NOTs = 0, ANDs = 3, ORs = 2


=== optimized solution ===

Negated inputs: in0, in1, carry_in
Products:
	[0] = in1 && carry_in
	[1] = in0 && carry_in
	[2] = in0 && in1
	[3] = carry_in && [2]
	[4] = in0 && !in1 && !carry_in
	[5] = !in0 && in1 && !carry_in
	[6] = !in0 && !in1 && carry_in
Sums:
	"sum" = [3] || [4] || [5] || [6]
	"carry_out" = [0] || [1] || [2]

Gate cost: NOTs = 3, ANDs = 10, ORs = 5
