solution:
in0in1 + in0carry-in + in1carry-in

=== optimized solution ===

Negated inputs: in0, in1, carry-in
Products: [0] = in0in1, [1] = in0carry-in, [2] = in1carry-in, [3] = in0[2], [4] = in0in1'carry-in', [5] = in0'in1carry-in', [6] = in0'in1'carry-in
Sums: [7] = [0][1][2], [8] = [3][4][5][6]
Final sums: "sum" = [8], "carry-out" = [7]

Gate scores: NOTs = 3, ANDs = 10, ORs = 5
