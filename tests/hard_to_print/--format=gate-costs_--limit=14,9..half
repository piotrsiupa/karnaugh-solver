Gate cost: NOTs = 1, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 1, cost without input NOTs = 0
Gate cost: NOTs = 1, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 1, cost without input NOTs = 0
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 2, cost without input NOTs = 0
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 1, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 1, cost without input NOTs = 0
