Gate cost: NOTs = 8, ANDs = 12, ORs = 3, overall cost = 38
Gate cost: NOTs = 6, ANDs = 12, ORs = 3, overall cost = 36
Gate cost: NOTs = 6, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2, overall cost = 28
Gate cost: NOTs = 8, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2, overall cost = 30
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 28, ANDs = 42, ORs = 10, overall cost = 132
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 14, ORs = 5, overall cost = 42
