Gate cost: NOTs = 8, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2, overall cost = 30, cost without input NOTs = 22
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 8, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2, overall cost = 30, cost without input NOTs = 22
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2, overall cost = 26, cost without input NOTs = 22
