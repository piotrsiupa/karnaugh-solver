Gate cost: NOTs = 6, ANDs = 12, ORs = 3, overall cost = 36, cost without input NOTs = 30
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 6, ANDs = 12, ORs = 3, overall cost = 36, cost without input NOTs = 30
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 10, ORs = 3, overall cost = 30, cost without input NOTs = 26
