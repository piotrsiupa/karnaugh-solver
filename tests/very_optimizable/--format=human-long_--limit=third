Gate cost: NOTs = 6, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2


=== optimized solution ===

Negated inputs: a, b, c, d
Products:
	[1] = ¬c ∧ d
	[2] = ¬a ∧ b
	[3] = [2] ∧ [1]
	[4] = c ∧ ¬d
	[5] = [2] ∧ [4]
	[6] = a ∧ ¬b
	[7] = [1] ∧ [6]
Sums:
	[10] = [5] ∨ [7]
	[11] = [3] ∨ [10]
	"third" = [11]

Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 7, ORs = 2
