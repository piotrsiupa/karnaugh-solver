Gate cost: NOTs = 8, ANDs = 12, ORs = 3, overall cost = 38, cost without input NOTs = 30
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 8, ANDs = 12, ORs = 3, overall cost = 38, cost without input NOTs = 30
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 8, ORs = 3, overall cost = 26, cost without input NOTs = 22
