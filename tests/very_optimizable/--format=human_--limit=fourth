--- fourth ---

(a ∧ ¬b ∧ ¬c ∧ d) ∨ (¬a ∧ b ∧ c ∧ ¬d) ∨ (¬a ∧ ¬b ∧ ¬c ∧ ¬d)

Gate cost: NOTs = 8, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2


=== optimized solution ===

Negated inputs: a, b, c, d
Products:
	[1] = ¬c ∧ d
	[2] = ¬a ∧ b
	[4] = c ∧ ¬d
	[5] = [2] ∧ [4]
	[6] = a ∧ ¬b
	[7] = [1] ∧ [6]
	[9] = ¬a ∧ ¬b ∧ ¬c ∧ ¬d
Sums:
	[10] = [5] ∨ [7]
	"fourth" = [9] ∨ [10]

Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2
