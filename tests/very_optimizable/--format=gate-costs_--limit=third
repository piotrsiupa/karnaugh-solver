Gate cost: NOTs = 6, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2, overall cost = 28, cost without input NOTs = 22
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 6, ANDs = 9, ORs = 2, overall cost = 28, cost without input NOTs = 22
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 7, ORs = 2, overall cost = 22, cost without input NOTs = 18
