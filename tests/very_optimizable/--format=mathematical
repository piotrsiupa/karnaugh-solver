Let:
p1(c, d) = ¬c ∧ d
p2(a, b) = ¬a ∧ b
p3(c, d) = c ∧ ¬d
p4(a, b) = a ∧ ¬b
s1(a, b, c, d) = (p2(a, b) ∧ p3(c, d)) ∨ (p1(c, d) ∧ p4(a, b))
s2(a, b, c, d) = (p2(a, b) ∧ p1(c, d)) ∨ s1(a, b, c, d)

Then:
first(a, b, c, d) = (p3(c, d) ∧ p4(a, b)) ∨ s2(a, b, c, d)
second(a, b, c, d) = (a ∧ b ∧ c ∧ d) ∨ s2(a, b, c, d)
third(a, b, c, d) = s2(a, b, c, d)
fourth(a, b, c, d) = (¬a ∧ ¬b ∧ ¬c ∧ ¬d) ∨ s1(a, b, c, d)
