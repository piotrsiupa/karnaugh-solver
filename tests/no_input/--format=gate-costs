Gate cost: NOTs = 0, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 0, cost without input NOTs = 0
Gate cost: NOTs = 0, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 0, cost without input NOTs = 0
Gate cost: NOTs = 0, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 0, cost without input NOTs = 0
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 0, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 0, cost without input NOTs = 0
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 0, ANDs = 0, ORs = 0, overall cost = 0, cost without input NOTs = 0
