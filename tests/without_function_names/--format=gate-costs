Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 1, ORs = 0, overall cost = 4, cost without input NOTs = 2
Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 2, ORs = 0, overall cost = 6, cost without input NOTs = 4
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 3, ORs = 0, overall cost = 10, cost without input NOTs = 6
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 2, ORs = 0, overall cost = 6, cost without input NOTs = 4
