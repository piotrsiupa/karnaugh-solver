Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 3, ORs = 1, overall cost = 10, cost without input NOTs = 8
Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 2, ORs = 1, overall cost = 8, cost without input NOTs = 6
=== summary ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 4, ANDs = 5, ORs = 2, overall cost = 18, cost without input NOTs = 14
=== optimized solution ===
Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 3, ORs = 2, overall cost = 12, cost without input NOTs = 10
