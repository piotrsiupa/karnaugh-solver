--- tricky_0 ---

(NOT a AND NOT c) OR (a AND b AND d)

Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 3, ORs = 1


--- tricky_1 ---

(a AND b) OR (NOT a AND NOT c)

Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 2, ORs = 1


=== optimized solution ===

Negated inputs: a, c
Products:
  [0] = a AND b
  [1] = d AND [0]
  [2] = NOT a AND NOT c
Sums:
  "tricky_0" = [1] OR [2]
  "tricky_1" = [0] OR [2]

Gate cost: NOTs = 2, ANDs = 3, ORs = 2
