# This test (only slightly modified) is used as the example in `README.md` and `--help`.
# Notice various ways of separating the values.
# (This is a comment btw; it will be ignored.)
a, b, c, d

# Solvers tend to get a solution for this one along the lines of a'b'd' + bc'd,
# instead of the optimal one: a'c' + abd. (1 less AND and 2 less NOTs)
 tricky_0    # You can also have whitespaces and other weird characters in these names but this breaks generated code.
  0; 5; 13  # Leading and training white characters are ignored. 
1; 2; 4; 15

# Solvers tend to not be biased against using NOT gates which often results in
# solution a'c' + ac, instead of bd + ab. (2 less NOTs)
# Beside that, this solution can reuse parts of the previous one reducing the
# amount of gates even further. (2 less ANDs)
tricky_1  # This name could be skipped. The program would generate one if needed.
