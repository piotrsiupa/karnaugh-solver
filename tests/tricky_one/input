a, b, c, d

# Solvers tend to get a solution for this one along the lines of a'b'd' + bc'd,
# instead of the optimal one: a'c' + abd. (1 less AND and 2 less NOTs)

# Solvers tend to not be biased against using NOT gates which often results in
# solution a'c' + ac, instead of bd + ab. (2 less NOTs)
# Beside that, this solution can reuse parts of the previous one reducing the
# amount of gates even further. (2 less ANDs)
